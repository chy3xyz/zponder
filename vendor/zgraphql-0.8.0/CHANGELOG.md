and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- **Concurrent sibling-field execution (并发版)**: sibling fields with resolvers now execute in parallel via `std.Io.concurrent` on the Io backend's worker threads, instead of sequentially. Concurrency is proven by a new test that observes overlapping resolver execution (`max_seen >= 2` across 4 spinning resolvers).
- **`Executor.setConcurrency(enabled)`** and `ServerOptions.enable_concurrent_execution` (default `true`): opt out for CPU-bound resolver sets or resolvers that mutate shared state. The toggle is threaded through both the HTTP (`server.zig`) and WebSocket (`server_ws.zig`) paths.
- **Concurrency regression tests**: parallel-execution proof, sequential fallback (`max_seen == 1`), and concurrent error collection (3 failing fields → 3 recorded errors, no lost entries).

### Fixed
- **Data race on `Executor.errors`**: concurrent field tasks on different Io workers could append to the shared errors list simultaneously. Appends are now guarded by a `std.atomic.Mutex`, so partial-result error collection is safe under parallel execution.
- **`recordError` leaked `msg` and path segments on `errors.append` failure**: `errdefer` chains now free the message and only the path segments actually duplicated (mid-loop OOM frees exactly the copied prefix).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **Subscription cross-allocator safety**: `Executor.executeSubscription`'s `next()` used to mix the caller's allocator (outer result) with the Executor's allocator (sub-selection data), so passing a different allocator would corrupt the heap. Sub-selection results are now cloned into the caller's allocator so the returned Value tree is uniformly owned.
- **Tenant isolation bypass in batch and WebSocket paths**: batched requests and WS single-shot queries passed `tenant=null` to the execution pipeline, so they fell back to global limits/schema instead of the resolved tenant's. Tenant resolution is now done before the WS upgrade and threaded through both paths.
- **SDL parser gaps**: added directive-definition parsing (`directive @x(...) [repeatable] on ...`), field `@deprecated(reason:)` parsing, argument default values, and leading `description` support for schema/types/fields/enum values/directives (with correct ownership); also fixed a double-free when registering parsed directives and a dangling `deprecation_reason`.
- **Introspection metadata**: `description` (schema/type/field/input/enum value) and `defaultValue` are now populated from the schema instead of always being `null`; enum values now report `deprecationReason`.
- **Validator spec gaps**: added UniqueOperationNames, LoneAnonymousOperation, NoUnusedFragments, VariablesAreInputTypes, constant variable defaults, and OverlappingFieldsCanBeMerged.
- **WS protocol**: handle `connection_terminate`.
- **`HttpCacheBackend.setImpl`/`deleteImpl` swallowed non-2xx status**: the HTTP status from `client.fetch` was discarded, so a failed cache write (404/500/503) silently reported success. Non-2xx now returns `error.CacheWriteFailed`.
- **`DataLoader.loadBatched` was broken dead code**: it used the removed `std.ArrayList.init` API and the old `Value.clone()`/`Value.deinit()` signatures, and had a malformed double-`!` return type. It now compiles and passes a fast-path test.
- **`DistributedCache.setValue` was broken dead code**: it accessed the removed `value.allocator` field and called `value.toJson()` without an allocator. Now uses `self.allocator`.
- **`ResponseCache.prune` / `QueryPlanCache.prune` / `RateLimiter.prune` were broken dead code**: `std.ArrayList.init` + `try dupe` in a `void` function (would not compile). Now use `std.array_list.Managed` and degrade gracefully on OOM.
- **`HttpCacheBackend` was broken dead code**: it used the pre-0.17 `std.http.Client.open` API (which no longer exists) and constructed `Client` without the required `io` field. Migrated to `client.fetch`; `init` now takes an `io` argument (breaking).
- **`TenantManager.tenantHooks` removed**: this uncalled helper attempted to capture the outer `base` parameter in a nested function (Zig has no closures), so it could never compile. It was never exported or used.
- **`Value.clone` OOM leak**: a successfully cloned child value leaked when the subsequent list append / map insert failed. Each cloned child is now cleaned up on error.
- **Docs**: `docs/API.md` / `docs/API.zh.md` Value lifecycle examples updated to the explicit-allocator signatures; `HttpCacheBackend.init` docs updated with the new `io` argument.

### Added
- **`zig build compile-all`**: a compile-time probe (`src/compile_all.zig`) that takes the address of every public function, forcing its body to be type-checked. This catches dead-code regressions (uncalled pub fns with compile errors) that Zig's lazy compilation would otherwise miss. Wired into `zig build test` and CI.
- Tests exercising the previously-dead code paths: `DataLoader.loadBatched` fast path, `DistributedCache.setValue`, `ResponseCache.prune`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- **`Value` no longer stores an allocator** (breaking): `deinit`, `clone`, `toJson`, and `writeJson` now take an explicit allocator argument, matching the Zig convention and enabling cross-allocator cloning (e.g. into an arena). `cloneWith` was folded into `clone(self, allocator)`; the allocator-dependent `format` method was removed.
- **`server.zig` split** into `server.zig` (HTTP core), `server_ws.zig` (WebSocket graphql-ws protocol), `server_apq.zig` (Automatic Persisted Queries), and `server_playground.zig` (playground HTML). `server.zig` dropped from ~2314 to ~1808 lines.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **Multi-tenant response cache isolation**: the response/distributed cache key was only the query string, so different tenants sharing a global cache could read each other's cached responses. The cache key is now tenant-scoped.
- **`DataLoader.load` swallowed errors**: lock and clone failures were silently converted to `null` (indistinguishable from a cache miss). `load` now returns `anyerror!?Value` and propagates errors.
- **OOM leaks across the engine** (found by new `checkAllAllocationFailures` tests):
  - `Parser.parseDocument`/`parseSelectionSet` leaked successfully parsed values when appending to the list failed.
  - `Schema.init` used `catch unreachable` for builtin-directive registration, panicking on OOM; it is now `!Schema` and propagates errors.
  - `registerBuiltinDirectives` lacked `errdefer` cleanup for directive/location/argument allocations.
  - `Executor` result-building used the `put(try dupe(...), value)` anti-pattern, leaking keys/values on OOM.
- **`Schema.init` is now fallible** (`!Schema`): OOM during builtin-directive registration no longer panics.
- **`queryIsQuery` keyword matching**: `queryFoo` no longer matches the `query` keyword; a whole-keyword check is used.

### Changed
- **Broken import cycle**: `server.zig` no longer imports `zgraphql.zig` (which re-exports it); it now imports internal modules directly, keeping embedded users who don't need the HTTP server out of the module graph.
- **Playground HTML split** into `src/server_playground.zig`.
- **`Value.cloneWith(allocator)`** added for cross-allocator cloning (arena/request-scoped reuse); `clone()` now delegates to it.

### Added
- OOM-injection tests for the parser and executor (every allocation failure is exercised).
- Concurrent `QueryCache` get/store test.
- Multi-tenant response-cache isolation test.
- Cross-allocator `Value.cloneWith` test.
- Benchmark JSON output (`BENCHMARK_JSON=...`) and a 100ms/iter catastrophic-regression smoke check.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **WS subscription path missing `user_data`**: the WebSocket subscription executor never called `setUserData`, so subscription resolvers received a null ctx and panicked on dereference (`attempt to use null value`). The subscription path now sets `user_data` like the HTTP query path.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **APQ use-after-free**: `resolvePersistedQuery` returned a `QueryCache` internal pointer that was freed by the caller, dangling the cache entry and double-freeing at shutdown. Cache lookups now return owned copies (matching `ResponseCache` semantics).
- **APQ error-path double free**: `provided_query` was freed before sending the error response; on error propagation the caller's deferred free then freed it again. Error responses are now sent before ownership is released.
- **Response cache leak**: L1 cache hit path duplicated an already-owned copy and leaked the first one.
- **QueryCache thread safety**: `QueryCache` was lock-free and unsafe under concurrent requests; all methods now use an internal spin lock.
- **Mutation/subscription response caching**: mutations (and subscriptions) with no variables were incorrectly cached and replayed; cacheable checks now verify the operation is a query.
- **`TenantManager` header ownership**: `setHeaderName`/`deinit` decided whether to free by comparing content to the default literal, leaking when the same string was heap-allocated; replaced with an explicit ownership flag.
- **`TenantManager.register` OOM cleanup**: `errdefer` freed uninitialized elements of the roles array on partial allocation failure; now tracks the filled count.
- **Cross-request variable leakage in `Executor`**: default variable values injected by `executeNamed` were never cleaned up, leaking into subsequent executions on a reused executor (and a double-free in the cleanup path).
- **Introspection validation no-op**: `__schema`/`__type` sub-selections were never actually validated because the introspection types are not registered in the user schema; added a real validator over the static introspection type system.
- **`DistributedCache` prefix lifetime**: `init` stored the caller's prefix by reference and `deinit` freed it, crashing on string literals; the prefix is now copied and ownership-tracked.
- **Validation error payload OOM leaks**: partially built error objects were not cleaned up on allocation failure.
- **Documentation errors**: README used a non-existent `ServerOptions.tenant_header` field; `DistributedCache` examples passed string literals as prefix; the subscription example bound `resolve` instead of `subscribe`; `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` contradicted itself about tenant isolation.
- **Example memory leaks**: `examples/dataloader.zig` and `examples/database.zig` leaked loaded values (double clone / missing deinit); `examples/complex.zig` used enum workarounds, an unused subscription, and redundant root-type wiring.
- **CI**: fuzz job swallowed failures with `|| true`; stress test was never run in CI; both are now enforced.
- **Error observability**: execution errors returned a generic "Execution error"; the response now includes the concrete error name, and GraphQL errors include `locations` (line/column).

### Added
- `examples/typesafe.zig`: runnable `TypeSafeSchemaBuilder` example.
- Mutation end-to-end tests (executor side effects, validator rejection without mutation root).
- Introspection validation tests (valid/unknown-field/leaf-with-sub-selection).
- Benchmark warm-up and schema-build-out-of-hot-loop improvements.
